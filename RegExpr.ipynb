    "\n",
    "- a, X, 9, < -- ordinary characters just match themselves exactly. The meta-characters which do not match themselves because they have special meanings are: . ^ $ * + ? { [ ] \\ | ( ) (details below)\n",
    "\n",
    "- . (a period) -- matches any single character except newline '\\n'\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\w -- (lowercase w) matches a \"word\" character: a letter or digit or underbar [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Note that although \"word\" is the mnemonic for this, it only matches a single word char, not a whole word. \\W (upper case W) matches any non-word character.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\b -- boundary between word and non-word\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\s -- (lowercase s) matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab, form [ \\n\\r\\t\\f]. \\S (upper case S) matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "- \\t, \\n, \\r -- tab, newline, return\n",
    "- \\d -- decimal digit [0-9] (some older regex utilities do not support but \\d, but they all support \\w and \\s)\n",
    "- ^ = start, $ = end -- match the start or end of the string\n",
    "- \\ -- inhibit the \"specialness\" of a character. So, for example, use \\. to match a period or \\\\ to match a slash. If you are unsure if a character has special meaning, such as '@', you can put a slash in front of it, \\@, to make sure it is treated just as a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Examples\n",
    "Joke: what do you call a pig with three eyes? piiig!\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rules of regular expression search for a pattern within a string are:\n",

    "Regular expression patterns pack a lot of meaning into just a few characters , but they are so dense, you can spend a lot of time debugging your patterns. Set up your runtime so you can run a pattern and print what it matches easily, for example by running it on a small test text and printing the result of findall(). If the pattern matches nothing, try weakening the pattern, removing parts of it so you get too many matches. When it's matching nothing, you can't make any progress since there's nothing concrete to look at. Once it's matching too much, then you can work on tightening it up incrementally to hit just what you want.\n",

This can trip you up -- you think .* matches everything, but by default it does not go past the end of a line. Note that \\s (whitespace) includes newlines, so if you want to match a run of whitespace that may include a newline, you can just use \\s*\n",

    "\n",
    "There is an extension to regular expression where you add a ? at the end, such as .*? or .+?, changing them to be non-greedy. Now they stop as soon as they can. So the pattern '(<.*?>)' will get just '<b>' as the first match, and '</b>' as the second match, and so on getting each <..> pair in turn. The style is typically that you use a .*?, and then immediately its right look for some concrete marker (> in this case) that forces the end of the .*? run.\n",
