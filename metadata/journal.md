## SWHAPPE journal.md Template

Here we propose a template for `journal.md` forSWHAPPE.

Each action on the Depository should have a corresponding record on the `journal.md` with the structure below.

Please note that:
* Name and Surname of actors should be linked to their paragraph in [actors.md](./actors.md) file;
* Items should be linked to the file [inside the repository](./raw_materials/);
* We recommend to use only one of the following roles for each record: Author, Collector, Curator;
* Dated records are from the newest to the oldest (new records written on top of the list);
* Notes are optional.

Example of Actor link:
~~~
[Name Surname](./actors.md#name-surname)
~~~
Example of Item link:
~~~
[Item Name](./material/example_file.zip)
