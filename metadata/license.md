# licence.md Template 

Here we propose a template for licence.md for SHWAP.

If the software uses a standard licence please link [SPDX](https://spdx.org/licenses/) 
and set the repository file LICENCE.md 
according to the [GitHub licencing guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository) and compliant with [common practice](see https://reuse.software/tutorial/).

In case of custom licence put the link to the actual licence specification file 
and copy its content into LICENCE.md 
according to the [GitHub licencing guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository) and compliant with [common practice](see https://reuse.software/tutorial/).

## Example with standard licence
[MIT Licence](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) : https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html

## Example with custom licence
[Custom Licence](./materials/Copyright) : ./materials/Copyright
